		<h2>Background</h2>
		<p>
			The Secchi depth of a lake is determined by the concentration of biomass in the water. An algae bloom on a lake
			leads to turbid and greenish water, making lakeside property less valuable and thus decreasing home prices. Algae blooms occur
			when nutrients mix and rise to the surface. For a detailed description of why a lake blooms, and for real-time displays of 
			water quality metrics, see the links in the sidebar. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The lake markers on the map represent the locations of the buoys on the lakes where Secchi depth
			measurements are taken. The Secchi depth, dissolved oxygen and temperature data displayed 
			is collected by the Colby College Department of Chemistry and is regularly updated. A lake with a
			Secchi depth of 2 or less is said to have "bloomed" because algal concentrations are so high. On the 
			Presentation webpage, this is represented by the lake turning green.
		</p>
		<p>
			To help keep your lake from blooming, and maintain the property value of your home, make sure to prevent nutrient runoff from entering
			the lake. Property owners should plant a buffer strip of vetgetation on the shoreline to catch runoff. All new property must be at least 
			100 feet from the water. If your property was built before the 100 foot rule came into effect, your home can only be expanded 30%.

		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>
			The Belgrade Lakes Water Clarity Presentation webpage was designed 
			and developed by Martin Deutsch, Colby College Class of 2019, in 
			cooporation with Professor of Economics Michael Donihue, Professor of 
			Chemistry Whitney King, and Professor of Computer Science Bruce Maxwell.
			The purpose of the project is to display the water quality of the Belgrade Lakes 
			and its effect on the surrounding properties in an interactive and informative fashion.
		</p>
		<p>
			The webpage was designed using the Google Maps Javascript API. The image of the Secchi Disk 
			and the cross section of a lake are from the University of Maryland <a href="http://ian.umces.edu/">
			Integration and Application Network</a>. The change in property values for a change in water clarity was 
			estimated using the Hedonic Model outlined in <a href=
			"http://econpapers.repec.org/article/uwplandec/v_3a76_3ay_3a2000_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a283-298.htm">
			Does the Measurement of Environmental Quality Affect Implicit Prices Estimated from 
			Hedonic Models?</a> (Michael 2000).
		</p>

			Funding for this webpage was provided by the 
			<a href ="https://www.colby.edu/president/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2013/12/greenefront.jpg">Colby College 
			Office of the President<a> and the <a href="http://www.colby.edu/goldfarb/">Goldfarb Center for Public Affairs 
			and Civic Engagement</a>. For more information on the project, please visit the
